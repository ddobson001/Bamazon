# Bamazon

Welcome to Bamazon;

To run the following application please install Nodejs and the following npm installs:
1. inquirer
2. mysql

Create a database in mySQL with the following:

1. Create a MySQL Database called `bamazon`.

2. Then create a Table inside of that database called `products`.

3. The products table should have each of the following columns:

   * item_id (unique id for each product)

   * product_name (Name of product)

   * department_name

   * price (cost to customer)

   * stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

After installing and creating the database above open the terminal and enter the following command: node bamazonCustomer.js. This will initiate the prompt.
